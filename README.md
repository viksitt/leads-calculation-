# leads-calculation-
This JavaScript code calculates a lead score based on four factors: Company Size, Annual Budget, Industry, and Urgency of Need.

For Company Size, higher employee numbers add more points.
For Annual Budget, larger budgets contribute more points.
For Industry, technology-related leads get the highest points, with other industries following.
For Urgency of Need, immediate needs are given the highest score, with longer-term needs getting fewer points.
The final score is calculated by adding points based on the lead's responses, and the result is returned as an object with the total score.
